              DUE: Saturday Midnight 2-22-2020
		  
    TA will check YOUR web page to verify the requirements

1. YOUR WEBSITE at cs360.eecs.wsu.edu
   Each of you has a user account on the Linux machine cs360.eecs.wsu.edu
        login name = YOUR last name     (lower case only)
        password   = YOUR WSU ID number (no leading 0)

2. Access YOUR website by

        http://cs360.eecs.wsu.edu/~YOURNAME
       
        ------------------------------------
        |    Welcome to YOUR Website       |
        |       ------------------         |
        |       | YOUR PICTURE   |         |
        |       ------------------         |
        | Input command  :  BOX            | 
        | Input filename1:  BOX            |
        | Input filename2:  BOX            | 
        | Submit command :  Submit BOX     |
        ------------------------------------

3. You will NOT like your current picture. Change it.
   In order to let us know you better, please use your OWN (.gif) picture
		   
4. When you click the Submit BOX, it submits the strings you entered to the
   httpd (Apache) server on the cs360.eecs.wsu.edu machine, directing it to 
   execute
             ~kcw/cgi-bin/mycgi.bin 
 
   which echos YOUR inputs and shows another input-submit window again.

5. login to your account. As of now, YOUR home directory contains:
 
        public_html --- index.html 
               |
            cgi-bin ---- mycgi.c util.o

5-1. Modify YOUR public_html/index.html file: CHANGE the line

< FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://cs360.eecs.wsu.edu/~kcw/cgi-bin/mycgi.bin" >

TO

< FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://cs360.eecs.wsu.edu/~YOURNAME/cgi-bin/mycgi.bin" >

5-2. Go to YOUR cgi-bin/ directory. Change the line in mycgi.c file

 printf("<FORM METHOD=\"POST\" ACTION=\"http://cs360.eecs.wsu.edu/~kcw/cgi-bin/mycgi.bin\">"); 

TO

 printf("<FORM METHOD=\"POST\" ACTION=\"http://cs360.eecs.wsu.edu/~YOURNAME/cgi-bin/mycgi.bin\">");

Then run
     cc -o mycgi.bin mycgi.c util.o   # generate YOUR OWN mycgi executable.
     chmod u+s mycgi.bin              # chmod mycgi to a SETUID executable

6. Access YOUR webpage again. Enter command and filenames. Then, Submit.
   It should execute YOUR mycgi program in YOUR cgi-bin/ directory.


======================= REQUIREMENTS ===============================


1. login to your account by

            ssh YOURNAME@cs360.eecs.wsu.edu
            Change YOUR current ugly picture to YOUR pretty picture.

NOTE: in order for us to know you better, please use a REAL picture of you.

2. MODIFY mycgi.c to do the following commands:

     mkdir dirname      // mkdir syscall
     rmdir dirname      // rmdir syscall
     rm    filename     // unlink syscall
     cat   filename     // cat in textbook
     cp    file1 file2  // cp  in textbook
     ls    [directory] <== if no directory, ls CWD // ls code in textbook
 
NOTE: YOUR mycgi.bin program is executed by an Apache process (uid=80). 
In order for the Apache process to write to YOUR directories, you MUST change 
YOUR mycgi.bin to a setuid program by
                    chmod u+s mycgi
When a process executes a setuid program, it temporarily assumes the uid of the
program owner, allowing it to write to the owner's directories.
